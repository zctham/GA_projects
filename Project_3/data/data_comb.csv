edge regression with edge features in graph neural networks,hey guys working on gnn to do edge regression using both node features and the edge weights of three types of edge it seems to me that when predicting target edge weight the neighbouring edge weights can carry interesting information at the same time including those edge weights as features obviously leads to leakage is there some way of dealing with this or am wrong in my assumptions my current approach is to basically stochastically drop out edges at each training epoch and remove the test edges from the graph entirely which has produced mild underwhelming improvement,1,edge regression with edge feature in graph neural network,hey guy working on gnn to do edge regression using both node feature and the edge weight of three type of edge it seems to me that when predicting target edge weight the neighbouring edge weight can carry interesting information at the same time including those edge weight a feature obviously lead to leakage is there some way of dealing with this or am wrong in my assumption my current approach is to basically stochastically drop out edge at each training epoch and remove the test edge from the graph entirely which ha produced mild underwhelming improvement

does web scraping look bad on resume,am currently master student and am applying for summer internships right now my previous job was at data analytics firm where one of my main duties was writing new or fixing old web scrapers the company scraped over websites everyday to collect data this data was then used for various projects my concern is that employers might look down upon it because web scraping is sort of grey area is this the case or am worried unnecessarily if it is something that looked down upon how can phrase it to sound better,1,doe web scraping look bad on resume,am currently master student and am applying for summer internship right now my previous job wa at data analytics firm where one of my main duty wa writing new or fixing old web scraper the company scraped over website everyday to collect data this data wa then used for various project my concern is that employer might look down upon it because web scraping is sort of grey area is this the case or am worried unnecessarily if it is something that looked down upon how can phrase it to sound better
multiple time series with exogenous variables the best approach,hi all have many different stores with their own weekly sales data let say stores each store has other time series data for example number of enquiries for that week there about of these time series that want to treat as exogenous variables stores with time series weekly sales data exogenous time series data for each store is there an appropriate time series model for this looked into hierarchical time series but couldn see how you could incorporate exogenous variables looked into your standard time series and it letting arima have exogenous variables is relatively straight forward in python however in this problem there is multiple time series for each store as an add on is it possible to add on to the time series other time independent data for example location of the store type of store etc right now my plan to approach this is by treating it as regression problem using the final week as the outcome variable and the starting weeks to represent growth in the exogenous time series think this would capture some of the relationship but it downside would be losing all the other time data points this isn huge project and the data set is relatively small it would be interested to hear your thoughts cheers,1,multiple time series with exogenous variable the best approach,hi all have many different store with their own weekly sale data let say store each store ha other time series data for example number of enquiry for that week there about of these time series that want to treat a exogenous variable store with time series weekly sale data exogenous time series data for each store is there an appropriate time series model for this looked into hierarchical time series but couldn see how you could incorporate exogenous variable looked into your standard time series and it letting arima have exogenous variable is relatively straight forward in python however in this problem there is multiple time series for each store a an add on is it possible to add on to the time series other time independent data for example location of the store type of store etc right now my plan to approach this is by treating it a regression problem using the final week a the outcome variable and the starting week to represent growth in the exogenous time series think this would capture some of the relationship but it downside would be losing all the other time data point this isn huge project and the data set is relatively small it would be interested to hear your thought cheer
chances as non statistician computer scientist,got my bachelors of engineering in summer and am currently finishing masters in information systems half of it is data science could sadly not apply for pure data science master degree as am writing my thesis and reading more and more into data mining and ai topics did have some basics in my masters realized that there is so much to learn and started wondering if will have chance against others who studied statistics computer science etc since they already covered lot of important topics during their studies that still have to learn how likely is it to get chance as junior data scientist after finish my studies imagine the competition being tough and without job cannot get the experience needed,1,chance a non statistician computer scientist,got my bachelor of engineering in summer and am currently finishing master in information system half of it is data science could sadly not apply for pure data science master degree a am writing my thesis and reading more and more into data mining and ai topic did have some basic in my master realized that there is so much to learn and started wondering if will have chance against others who studied statistic computer science etc since they already covered lot of important topic during their study that still have to learn how likely is it to get chance a junior data scientist after finish my study imagine the competition being tough and without job cannot get the experience needed

how do convince my boss we should use python,hi using throwaway in the off chance my boss sees this early career yoe before my current position started this new position in relatively immature and small data team at large corporation few months ago the team has existed in some form for about years but other than my boss the team is fresh as of love the organization in the company overall is good and for all intents and purposes my boss is great manager and great coworker and the team works well together but we have strong disagreement about one thing when first started he told me that the team doesn really do coding any sort of programming language figured that was okay as long as the job gets done it doesn really matter what tools we use and at this point in my career didn want to do heavy software engineering mle however found that the no code tool we use has some major deficiencies we use ibm spss modeler and it has an abysmal community luckily it easy enough to learn and got the hang of it quickly but it really not capable of any advanced analytics or machine learning it has tools for many machine learning algorithms but they re very limited and they re black boxes trying to shape the data and manipulate the parameters for even simple regressions takes lot of struggling it requires dragging and dropping dozens of nodes to make the model function appropriately and even then it is sub optimal and cannot be tweaked easily spss modeler works great for simple manipulations etl eda and basic analysis it fast to get job running and easy to understand even if you ve never used it before because it visual but anything past the basics it slow convoluted and rigid it lacks functionality and it is difficult to impossible to document and replicate the jobs or at least that my experience my boss is extremely hesitant to introduce any code to our workflows he allowed me to write few scripts for use in production only when ve demonstrated that spss modeler is entirely incapable of it however things really heated up when we hired nd data scientist and they offered much more resistance to our current process essentially refusing to use spss modeler and write code in python anyway as team we re transitioning our use of some other tools at the moment and it seems like we re reaching point where we ll my boss be making more substantive decisions ve asked for advice from some others in the organization and they ve helped me make sure approaching this issue professionally was intending to make formal proposal for greater and official adoption of coding basically python but now it seems like ll have to speed that process up so to datascience more want advice on how to specifically justify argue the case for the technology amp x200b my boss concerns with python coding he and one other member on the team have no experience coding so we can totally abandon spss modeler anyway and wouldn argue for that related to above he doesn want to read bunch of code he doesn want to mix our process using some spss modeler and some python he doesn want to jump back and forth between tools to get job done he doesn believe that code is easily or effectively documented recently set up git repos and documentation for all of the code along with best and standard practices much of which is adopted from other organizations at our company he worried about continuity consistency if out he may have to run my code the documentation should solve this he worried about incongruent dev environments everything will be in jupyter notebooks this along with documentation should solve the issue there are different coding styles or the other ds may write our code differently and this introduces inconsistencies especially if someone new is hired documentation and sticking to our documented best practices should solve the bulk of this he concerned about turnover if or the other ds leaves someone will have to pick up that process code and maintain it he doesn believe this will be possible with code if someone new is hired they may have to learn python or they may introduce their own programming language and that ll complicate things further don think this is an issue it much easier to translate from python to or to java than from spss modeler to anything else chance someone being hired for the title of data scientist will know some programming language and chance they will not know spss modeler and they probably won be as patient as me as we have learned in the hiring process for the company at large there is coding test for data scientists if there is logical error in the code then something will get messed up this is especially worse if he or the other no code employee have to run our code but don know how to fix it don think this is an issue because we essentially just need to have high quality work and stick closely to our best practices the same exact thing can and does happen with spss modeler except it harder to diagnose and fix there are probably some other concerns he has but these represent his main issues essentially he doesn believe that code is maintainable documentable or replicable but spss modeler is and think the opposite is the truth oh forgot we also can version our spss modeler jobs other than saving multiple copies of it on the network drive and we can see the differences without opening them and every node in the job up amp x200b again he otherwise great person to work with and this hasn truly caused any problems yet but it probably will soon if we don settle it working on writing proposal but not sure how to highlight articulate the advantages of coding over this software most of his issues aren with the functionality of python just how it works operationally,1,how do convince my bos we should use

could should javascript have been the defacto ds language,specifically possibly naively wish python didn exist and javascript was used in it place but this might be misguided so am here to ask for counter arguments and by javascript mean javascript with runtime like node or deno but why javascript visualisation is large part of data science and most libraries seem to use web technologies under the hood for good reason since web technologies are powerful and mature and make sharing visualiations over the web easy while most libraries provide python wrapper which will be sufficient in many cases often find it easier to work directly in javascript especially when the end product is dashboard or entire website rather than single chart in my limited understanding javascript is similar enough to python that it could be used for data science in place of python the main points similarities being it has short simple easy to learn syntax which doesn require annotating types the language itself is not that fast but can easily call libraries for the computationally intensive tasks required in ds flexible multi paradigm language which allows libraries to provide an easy to use api without much cermony and boilerplate repl the difference is that where to me it seems javascript could be used in place of python for ds python could not have been used in place of javascript as the web browser language since it is blocking doesn run in an event loop like python javascript was purpose built for web browsers python was not purpose built for ds to me the only reason python is used for ds is because of it first mover advantage and the huge third party library ecosystem many languages are popular more because mostly because of their ecosystem and that fine don expect this to change but it is just annonying that it seems just javascript could be used where instead we need to use python and javascript know people will argue that multiple programming languages are inevitable and you should pick the right tool for the job etc and agree but having to use two languages simultaneously is much more inefficient learning the languages themselves is not so bad but having to learn two different ecosystems and constantly switch between the languages and remeber the different apis has large impact on productivity for me at least this is compounded by the fact that data scientists are often not the most experienced programmers where much of the training and experience is dedicated to analysis rather than simply programming like developer could make similar but admitedly less convincing arguments for rust replacing the entire python javascript data science stack but that should be separate post,1,could should javascript have been the defacto d language,specifically

advice for re learning statistics,took stats few years back and didn do that well in it transitioning to point where probably going to have to use stats more and was wondering what the best way to go about re learning stats was short of reading textbook front to back have all my old stats notes so can find how to do test or do things of that nature but part of why didn do well was because we were just given bunch of equations and no explanation of the underlying context purpose not as interested in the formulas would just implement these in python scipy anyways lol so much as the how why when of when to apply the various formulas and when to model what data as what distribution and so on any advice liked jake vanderplaas statistics for hackers but as far as know that only exists as minute lecture and not textbook,1,advice for re learning statistic,took stats few year back and didn do that well in it transitioning to point where probably going to have to use stats more and wa wondering what the best way to go about re learning stats wa short of reading textbook front to back have all my old stats note so can find how to do test or do thing of that nature but part of why didn do well wa because we were just given bunch of equation and no explanation of the underlying context purpose not a interested in the formula would just implement these in python scipy anyways lol so much a the how why when of when to apply the various formula and when to model what data a what distribution and so on any advice liked jake vanderplaas statistic for hacker but a far a know that only exists a minute lecture and not textbook

declarative libraries for analysis where are they,hi as the title suggest find it suprisingly difficult to find libraries where analysis modelling is done in declarative way say for example want to train and evaluate logistic regression model then need to split my data in test train train it on the train set predict on test and evaluate all these steps are usually easy enough to do and have high level functions but still manually putting the steps together describing how_ to do what want instead of just describing what_ want to me this gives huge uncertainty in my own analysis yes have split my data into test train but there no certainty that actually using them in the correct way in this simple case it might be easy enough but add pre processing calibration and so on and suddenly the complexity explodes this came up for me because used to do this kind of work in and now have project in python in there tidymodels where especially the package workflows is very close to what want workflows is still surprisingly new for something that think is neccesary for being confident in your model evaluations and such using scikit learn in python but can find anything similar to that think the closest thing is big machine learning experiment management like neptune but that also seems bit overkill so where are these libraries do they exist and just haven searched enough or am wrong and dumb and missing something for wanting this or am really just interrested in standarized and validated setups workflows pipelines and the declarative part is actually not that important looking forward to your comments,1,declarative library for analysis where are they,hi a the title suggest find it suprisingly difficult to find library where analysis modelling is done in declarative way say for example want to train and evaluate logistic regression model then need to split my data in test train train it on the train set predict on test and evaluate all these step are usually easy enough to do and have high level function but still manually putting the step together describing how_ to do what want instead of just describing what_ want to me this give huge uncertainty in my own analysis yes have split my data into test train but there no certainty that actually using them in the correct way in this simple case it might be easy enough but add pre processing calibration and so on and suddenly the complexity explodes this came up for me because used to do this kind of work in and now have project in python in there tidymodels where especially the package workflow is very close to what want workflow is still surprisingly new for something that think is neccesary for being confident in your model evaluation and such using scikit learn in python but can find anything similar to that think the closest thing is big machine learning experiment management like neptune but that also seems bit overkill so where are these library do they exist and just haven searched enough or am wrong and dumb and missing something for wanting this or am really just interrested in standarized and validated setup workflow pipeline and the declarative part is actually not that important looking forward to your comment

resources for data quality in banking financial services,hello part of team tasked with assuring data quality of large database of financial data credit cards collaterals etc we re essentially looking for anomalies such as single outliers or abnormal grouped behavior by analyzing trends through time we re doing very basic stuff average std med range through time with powerbi but would like for us to go beyond and increase the complexity of our analysis by using python or the stuff find online seems to be mostly related to it such as network data monitoring but maybe not searching using the right terms would greatly appreciate if you had any titles of books or research paper pertaining to techniques or methods that would be applicable to the banking sector or maybe just concepts that could search for thanks,1,resource for data quality in banking financial service,hello part of team tasked with assuring data quality of large database of financial data credit card collateral etc we re essentially looking for anomaly such a single outlier or abnormal grouped behavior by analyzing trend through time we re doing very basic stuff average std med range through time with powerbi but would like for u to go beyond and increase the complexity of our analysis by using python or the stuff find online seems to be mostly related to it such a network data monitoring but maybe not searching using the right term would greatly appreciate if you had any title of book or research paper pertaining to technique or method that would be applicable to the banking sector or maybe just concept that could search for thanks

how to simply characterize curve shapes,hello so have time series dataframe where one column is chronological timestamps and then next column are unique values in values column with each value associated with its corresponding timestamp that it just those two columns in the dataframe can then plot this data and produce plotted curve with timestamps on the axis and values on the axis can observe how the curve goes up and down down and up and how many times the slope changes from positive to negative and vice versa now have many of these same type of dataframes let say have of these dataframes each with defining curve shape what want to do is eventually cluster these curve shapes into essentially taking all of the curve shapes and essentially saying ok see we have curve type curve type and curve type etc and these are the categories all dataframes fall into would then assign each dataframe its identified curve type now the big challenge am struggling with is how do you characterize curve what would the characteristics be so that they can be grouped together know there are probably some really complex curve shape clustering packages out there but in my experience these are very in depth and complex and can be bit of black box am looking for method that is super intuitive and straightforward for example one characteristic can think of is the number of count of the number of peaks and valleys in curve for instance lets say we have two types of curves where we see lots of ups and downs and where there are just few ups and downs just counting the number of peaks and valleys we could then cluster the curve populations into two distinct curve shape types but what other characteristics specifically simple and direct characteristics that could define curves that could count calculate and then use for clustering am open to suggestions here and would really appreciate any guidance on this also my apologies for this probably not being clear as could be here am really struggling to articulate this objective into the most clear terms and explanation thanks,1,how to simply characterize curve shape,hello so have time series dataframe where one column is chronological timestamps and then next column are unique value in value column with each value associated with it corresponding timestamp that it just those two column in the dataframe can then plot this data and produce plotted curve with timestamps on the axis and value on the axis can observe how the curve go up and down down and up and how many time the slope change from positive to negative and vice versa now have many of these same type of dataframes let say have of these dataframes each with defining curve shape what want to do is eventually cluster these curve shape into essentially taking all of the curve shape and essentially saying ok see we have curve type curve type and curve type etc and these are the category all dataframes fall into would then assign each dataframe it identified curve type now the big challenge am struggling with is how do you characterize curve what would the characteristic be so that they can be grouped together know there are probably some really complex curve shape clustering package out there but in my experience these are very in depth and complex and can be bit of black box am looking for method that is super intuitive and straightforward for example one characteristic can think of is the number of count of the number of peak and valley in curve for instance let say we have two type of curve where we see lot of ups and down and where there are just few ups and down just counting the number of peak and valley we could then cluster the curve population into two distinct curve shape type but what other characteristic specifically simple and direct characteristic that could define curve that could count calculate and then use for clustering am open to suggestion here and would really appreciate any guidance on this also my apology for this probably not being clear a could be here am really struggling to articulate this objective into the most clear term and explanation thanks

how do you encode multi class target variable,hello everyone am working on multi class classification problem my question is since our target variable is also categorical variable we have to encode it before training it but haven been able to decide how to encode it since it the target variable it not ordinal so we can use simple label encoder for this would love any insights about this,1,how do you encode multi class target variable,hello everyone am working on multi class classification problem my question is since our target variable is also categorical variable we have to encode it before training it but haven been able to decide how to encode it since it the target variable it not ordinal so we can use simple label encoder for this would love any insight about this

mathematical analysis of two changing variables affecting an output through an unknown formula,don know if this is the place to pose such question but ll try my best to describe the problem interested to discover if there is mathematical analytical approach to solving it let say you have device in front of you that has digital number display and two dials and both dials go from the number to built into the logic of this device there is formula that takes the output of both dials and generates number on the display that number can only be positive thinks pseudo random numbers now an objective of using this device would be to turn both dials and find the best combination of both turned dials to output the maximum highest number possible what makes this more difficult is that the relationship between any one dial value in isolation to the output value on the display is not linear meaning that setting only dial or alone to wont give the highest number on the display meaning that if you set dial at and only turn dial to see that the display shows that number on the display seems to go up and down seemingly randomly but consistent whilst turning directly from to on dial the same thing on dial is apparent but with it turned in isolation shows different values although these values shown are repeatable according to the location of the dials between to now if this information was simply fed into computer it could simply brute force the best combination of both dials by comparing every possible combination and checking the output display but here is where my question spawns from without testing both dials in combination until you find the highest display value is there mathematical approach to find the highest value possible from setting both dials in combination but only using the information gathered from each dial in isolation to tell you what those two dails numbers should be setting dial to zero and sweeping dial from to and recording all displayed outputs then setting dial to and sweeping dial from to and record all displayed outputs then somehow using this data to predict which combination of dial set to number between to and dial set to number between to would result in the highest displayed number without brute forcing it by setting dial to then recording all output values of dial sweeping to then setting dial to etc let me know if this is dumb question but don know how else to describe this problem,1,mathematical analysis of two changing variable affecting an output through an unknown formula,don know if this is the place to pose such question but ll try my best to describe the problem interested to discover if there is mathematical analytical approach to solving it let say you have device in front of you that ha digital number display and two dial and both dial go from the number to built into the logic of this device there is formula that take the output of both dial and generates number on the display that number can only be positive think pseudo random number now an objective of using this device would be to turn both dial and find the best combination of both turned dial to output the maximum highest number possible what make this more difficult is that the relationship between any one dial value in isolation to the output value on the display is not linear meaning that setting only dial or alone to wont give the highest number on the display meaning that if you set dial at and only turn dial to see that the display show that number on the display seems to go up and down seemingly randomly but consistent whilst turning directly from to on dial the same thing on dial is apparent but with it turned in isolation show different value although these value shown are repeatable according to the location of the dial between to now if this information wa simply fed into computer it could simply brute force the best combination of both dial by comparing every possible combination and checking the output display but here is where my question spawn from without testing both dial in combination until you find the highest display value is there mathematical approach to find the highest value possible from setting both dial in combination but only using the information gathered from each dial in isolation to tell you what those two dail number should be setting dial to zero and sweeping dial from to and recording all displayed output then setting dial to and sweeping dial from to and record all displayed output then somehow using this data to predict which combination of dial set to number between to and dial set to number between to would result in the highest displayed number without brute forcing it by setting dial to then recording all output value of dial sweeping to then setting dial to etc let me know if this is dumb question but don know how else to describe this problem

please help me understand this data from vaers,so please first let me state that absolutely pro vaccine and not trying to demonstrate anything here just thought that the vaers vaccine adverse event report system data was an interesting place to learn some data analysis and data investigation skills on my free time during holidays here is the claim trying to investigate among the deaths linked to the pfizer vaccine in the us only handful have been causally attributed to the vaccine and the rest is supposed to be temporal coincidences people will sometimes die wether they have taken vaccine or not to investigate this claim propose to look at the distribution of the number of days elapsed between taking the vaccine and dying for each case recorded in vaers in my hypothesis is if the death and the vaccine aren causally linked the distribution of the observed time delay between vaccination and death should be approximately uniform people have the same probability of dying the day when they are vaccinated the morrow the day after that the th day after that here is my procedure using pandas on the data downloadable from vaers found death events with non nan entries remained after removing badly formatted datedied and vax date entries remained after removing entries with negative number of days elapsed between death and vaccine amp x200b amp x200b plotted two histograms one with the axis ranging from to days the other from to days see attached contrary to my hypothesis the distribution is not at all uniform but instead seems to be exponentially decreasing with maximum at day also there is small bump centered around days my tentavive explanations are not everyone has been vaccinated at the same time and this will tend to skew the distribution to the left simply because people vaccinated during last month cannot contribute to values greater than days for example dont know how to estimate this effect overall but since vaccination rates have plateaued for at least few months dont expect it to be significant in the range days am right is there any other probabilistic effect that missing the adverse event are under reported and the more the vaccine is ancient the less probable it is that death is reported in vaers this is think almost surely happening but wouldnt expect such big drop in reports between day and especially for an adverse event as tragic as death the bump at days may be due to the pediod around april where vaccination rates were steeply increasing the causal link between vaccines and death are stronger than expected causing the left skew amp

report framework trying to move away from excel for report creation and management,originally posted on analytics but submitting here as do believe there is data science solution to this problem am

template using sumifs and xlookups using this method works fine in the first few months of the year as the raw data files are still small however when we reach month or these files have too many rows

the burden on excel the problem with this is that am the only user with an alteryx license so when refreshing this etl workflow no one other than myself can do that making this an ineffective solution

math teacher looking to become data analyst gt data scientist looking for advice on my resume and on the projects ve done that demonstrate my ability to work in those fields,hi everyone have strong passion for math enjoy problem solving and find satisfaction in being able to help others which is what got me into teaching in the first place over the past two years ve become somewhat disillusioned with teaching searching for other fields to transition into that would allow me to continue using math and my analytical skills and data science sparked an interest in me without any previous experience know this will be tough transition to make however hoping that my strong background in math combined with my ability to explain things teach to those who may not be math people will give me leg up do not expect to land job as data scientist right away instead looking more towards beginning as data analyst gaining some experience with the goal to ultimately become data scientist through mutual friends ve interviewed few data analysts scientists who recommended that build portfolio of work to show potential employers what capable of which are linked below these people also recommended focus primarily on building skills with sql dash boarding tools like tableau and python and ve spent the last two years building proficiency in these areas the projects below focus heavily on python some tableau and little sql ve had hard time figuring out what kind of project can create to showcase sql skills through github but do have two repos on there that contain solutions to many sql puzzles in case need to demonstrate something if you could please take look over my resume and or my projects love some feedback feel as if ready to start applying for analyst jobs however with no

intern working on forecasting project don know how to proceed,hi everyone so an intern on small company people and working here for little more than months started working on time series forecasting project and there is people formally working on that project including me but no one have expertise in time series forecasting our task is to improve the forecasting system of our client who uses classical models and we are trying to use ml models to include various features since entered became responsible for lot of tasks in the project including presenting results to the client even though just an intern and the current implementation of our solution was pretty much done by me just worked on the original proposed solution but gave some suggestions as we went think that should feel grateful for their trust but feel the lack of guidance and to be honest just afraid of not producing good solution since it is my first project the problem is that we are not getting very good results and as studied noticed that it is indeed pretty difficult to do better than classical models but the project is already late and we need to deliver something what think we should have done since the beginning was baseline model using classical solutions so our client and ourselves could have good idea of what to expect asked about the quality of the project at various moments and no one gave satisfactory answer what plan we could follow kept doing my tasks and since they didn said anything presumed did everything right next week we need to present the performance of our system and don know what could do to improve it don think it possible right know without changing our model and for what ve read more intelligent solution would just to stick to classical models afraid the client won be satisfied and feeling responsible if the project fail another point is that thinking about just changing careers during this internship perceived that really don like to do analysis and presenting insights to clients really disliked this part of the job my experience in previous projects was programming deep learning architectures not analysis so decided to jump to engineering think ll receive an offer in the next days to full time position as software machine learning engineer and now feeling guilty about abandoning the internship in the middle of project that isn going well and was responsible for implementing big part of it but well just the intern how should deal with this situation,1,intern working on forecasting project don know how to proceed,hi everyone so an intern on small company people and working here for little more than month started working on time series forecasting project and there is people formally working on that project including me but no one have expertise in time series forecasting our task is to improve the forecasting system of our client who us classical model and we are trying to use ml model to include various feature since entered became responsible for lot of task in the project including presenting result to the client even though just an intern and the current implementation of our solution wa pretty much done by me just worked on the original proposed solution but gave some suggestion a we went think that should feel grateful for their trust but feel the lack of guidance and to be honest just afraid of not producing good solution since it is my first project the problem is that we are not getting very good result and a studied noticed that it is indeed pretty difficult to do better than classical model but the project is already late and we need to deliver something what think we should have done since the beginning wa baseline model using classical solution so our client and ourselves could have good idea of what to expect asked about the quality of the project at various moment and no one gave satisfactory answer what plan we could follow kept doing my task and since they didn said anything presumed did everything right next week we need to present the performance of our system and don know what could do to improve it don think it possible right know without changing our model and for what ve read more intelligent solution would just to stick to classical model afraid the client won be satisfied and feeling responsible if the project fail another point is that thinking about just changing career during this internship perceived that really don like to do analysis and presenting insight to client really disliked this part of the job my experience in previous project wa programming deep learning architecture not analysis so decided to jump to engineering think ll receive an offer in the next day to full time position a software machine learning engineer and now feeling guilty about abandoning the internship in the middle of project that isn going well and wa responsible for implementing big part of it but well just the intern how should deal with this situation

the more think of my data career the more anxious become mid career,sorry for the clickbait title but exhausted this probably isn the right sub but need some assistance also extremely lucky make good money pretty good job boss who get along with and lot of autonomy data is pretty straight forward sales finance product marketing data the part that exhausts me is reading the data labor market and trying to make sense of trends to plan for what to come it plagued me for two years now and cannot infer enough to make decision for what my next step forward should be due to the ever changing landscape this industry is tumultuous and drastically inconsistent to say the least started in bi several years ago after earning bachelors in accounting and then taking it courses at community college mainly db and sql centered classes up until or so hadn really worried about what to come because often felt like my skill set was enough so just kept going deeper with sql dbs and bi tools figured that would top out as bi director and then decide what should do next well next is now for the past two companies have worked as an individual contributor director yes in the start up technology space we unfortunately exist saas technology is the industry prefer since it aligns with my interests the fact of the matter is since everything continues to evolve fear ll eventually fall behind because don have the formal technical nor quantitative credentials when going for the next role whatever that should be ve looked into ds roles but haven ever built ml model haven put any into production either because any forecasting prediction ve come across was handled by fp amp no one in product has given damn about analytics because they swag everything everything in finance goes by their rules not by statistics sales is the same they have set of rules they abide by ve tried thinking in terms of using statistics but it seems very rare to find someone who cares about them or how it would lead to something other than nice to have on the technical side everything except for the edw is built out spend of my time on sql and of dashboarding and visualizations work on jobs in the edw work on modeling reports etc ve sped up business processes that took days down to hours from f300 companies to these start ups it seems cs and stats knowledge is on the fringes at best what am supposed to do as approach my like to have masters degree as signal that either formally educated to where if encounter ds topics in bi won just swag it feel like the cs part is the safest bet since can always fall back in bi dev or data analytics engineer type roles but lose out on statistics similarly if go statistics feel like will never use the knowledge or that it overkill for what do does

career advice,ve been working in higher education for years as an academic librarian have phd in political science and lot of practical experience collecting analyzing data whether it be for my own research or more directly related to my day to day duties throughout my career have been involved with and led what we call assessment efforts within higher education essentially this means collecting various data related to the things we do and student success outcomes to help better illustrate our value to stakeholders comply with various accrediting bodies and guide organizational decision making build databases dashboards create various visualizations conduct survey based satisfaction research etc over the past few years have also been involved with the development of an open source data warehouse solution for libraries and similar organizations am not programmer but more of an analyst though did minor in computer science in college and have some low level programming experience got into couple of years ago and have published couple of articles on basic machine learning solutions within the library environment using adaboost to predict library use patterns to be honest feel like my talents are wasted in libraries unfortunately am very good at administrative work meetings planning paperwork etc so have been pigeon holed into that role so of my time is spent doing what feels like rote nonsense my wife recently landed job at big company and the pay is ridiculous like twice what make and not doing bad find myself wondering why am running myself into the ground doing inconsequential work that unfulfilling know can do more and have talents that are withering on the vine so to speak understand data and statistical methods fairly well though am constantly finding that there more to learn am fairly weak at programming in the sense that don have ton of practical experience though have demonstrated an ability to teach myself quite bit and if had the time to focus on it could be much better the problem is that my job doesn require me to do that so it difficult to make time for it of course am willing to make the time in my private life which have done in the past with other pursuits earned my phd while working full time as librarian writing that page dissertation was full time job in itself with that said am very proficient at designing experiments designing deploying practical data collection tools analyzing data writing reports and presenting to small large groups of non expert and expert audiences as an academician this is simply what do so my question is what do need to do to be competitive for some of these jobs see staff data scientist at reddit do simply need more programming chops python etc would appreciate any advice you professional data scientists can send my way thanks so much for reading all of this,1,career advice,ve been working in higher education for year a an academic librarian have phd in political science

simple and effective way to go from beginner to intermediate level of ml knowledge,read the scikit learn user guide from top to bottom this is not even joke it contains many examples tips and teaches you to work with their api to avoid common pitfalls actually explains part of the underlying math and links to relevant books papers by reading it you ll come into contact with ton of methods you probably never heard of as beginner like gaussian process kernel ridge regression and tons of methods in robust statistics encourage you to take notes watch video and learn about these methods you may want to start with chapter first but that up to you when you re done you can attempt to do the same thing for statsmodels but that will be considerably more painful,1,simple and effective way to go from beginner to intermediate level of ml knowledge,read the scikit learn user guide from top to bottom this is not even joke it contains many example tip and teach you to work with their api to avoid common pitfall actually explains part of the underlying math and link to relevant book paper by reading it you ll come into contact with ton of method you probably never heard of a beginner like gaussian process kernel ridge regression and ton of method in robust statistic encourage you to take note watch video and learn about these method you may want to start with chapter first but that up to you when you re done you can attempt to do the same thing for statsmodels but that will be considerably more painful

principal components regression question,hello friends had quick question about principal component regression does anyone know if you can regress principal components and the raw covariates that they are calculated from in the same model for example if we are predicting wage based on education work experience state of residence race etc could we compute two principal components pc1 and pc2 and later regress wage b0 b1pc1 b2pc2 b3education b4work experience b5state of residence b6race would there be multicollinearity issues between the principal components and the original covariates would it make sense to do this have done this in stata and it doesn drop any variables for collinearity issues but it does help my predictions any help would be appreciated thanks,1,principal component regression question,hello friend had quick question about principal component regression doe anyone know if you can regress principal component and the raw covariates that they are calculated from in the same model for example if we are predicting wage based on education work experience state of residence race etc could we compute two principal component pc1 and pc2 and later regress wage b0 b1pc1 b2pc2 b3education b4work experience b5state of residence b6race would there be multicollinearity issue between the principal component and the original covariates would it make sense to do this have done this in stata and it doesn drop any variable for collinearity issue but it doe help my prediction any help would be appreciated thanks

college sophomore need advice for learning improving data analysis skills,hi am currently college sophomore in the us double majoring in mathematics and computer science so far have been interested in data analysis and data visualization as potential career path think am good in terms of academics but am lacking technical skills which suppose is common issue participated in summer research mentoring program which introduced me to and my mentor suggested me to go through hadley for data science book got through half of it and used some of my knowledge to create poster presentation it was pretty simple with few tables summary stats and linear aggression then the fall semester started so couldn keep up my independent study also work as research assistant but haven done much work there other than running files or storing data in excel sheets the professor work with recently introduced me to sql he said its really easy to learn so kinda know bit of that now also know some java from the cs class took this semester other than that have bunch of leadership experience but its not really relevant to the field tried applying to summer internships but didn get any responses think some of my problems are lack of technical skills experience being sophomore feel like most companies are looking for juniors seniors and being minor will be in few weeks but entered college bit early so am not yet of legal age lot of internship applications ask if you re of legal age which think also puts me at disadvantage either way decided to stop applying to internships and wait for my junior year in the meantime thought would work on my resume am currently planning to finish the hadley book and maybe ask the professor work with if he has any projects can participate in from my internship search know lot of companies also look for python but am hoping to learn that through one of my cs classes in my junior year other than that am not sure what else to do know need to learn different skills relevant to the data analysis field but then what am supposed to do after have learned the content people say to practice but don understand what that means even with feel like have forgotten lot of what learned few months ago would probably remember stuff once pick up the hadley book but how can make sure that maintain my skills know said will ask my professor but am not sure if he will have something for me if not will probably have to practice with my own projects but don get how that works like where do start how do come up with project on my own how do find way to apply my skills and not only maintain them but also improve this was long post but wanted to give enough context and what my current plans are am basically looking for any advice pertaining to the questions asked or the data analytics fields in general also if you think should try learning some other skills before applying to internships next year let me know of those as well,1,college sophomore need advice for

quick primer players in the hiring process,lot of people here are early in their careers and may not understand who all fits into the hiring process and how so here quick primer the hiring manager is the person in charge of deciding who ultimately gets hired of the time this will be the person who manages the candidate being hired the hiring manager is responsible for defining what they want in candidate what they will be doing etc the way they do this is by writing job description which outlines the skills and experience person should have as well as what they will be doing the hr comp department will then take job description and grade it decide how much someone in that role should be paid this is the team that says if you want someone with years of experience and grad degree they should get xk year then comes your hr business partner as hiring manager you don normally talk to the comp team directly your hr bp is the one who coordinates everything and they can also be the one to give you insights into how jd may influence comp example they may tell you if you make grad degree optional the max they will approve is if you want to go higher than that you ll need to require grad degree then there the recruiter aka talent acquisition these are the people that find candidates and do the initial screening on them reading resumes and conducting an initial interview important callout data science recruiter likely has no experience with data science however if they are good recruiters they understand what data scientists do and how they talk about it having said that they re only screening they are mostly making sure that what you said you did is legit and that it generally matches what the hiring manager wants most of the rest of the process is handled by the hiring manager with hr primarily helping administratively setting up meetings sending emails etc hr doesn make decisions other than screening and grading hr is there purely to carry out their process points of conflict between hiring managers and hr bad grading you put together reasonable job description and the grading comes under what you expected normally this happens when companies use bad comparison points to find comparable salaries to ds they use it professionals or instead of using data in your high col city using state wide data that can lead to job description padding when you make the job description much demanding than what you re willing to hire so you can pay what you want bad screenings your recruiter filters out people because they have ms in biostats instead of stats or they just don know that operations research is relevant discipline or they will let people through that don have the right experience lazy recruiters recruiters do two things to find candidates look at who applied and actively look for candidates who may be passive lazy ones don do the second part,1,quick primer player in the hiring process,lot of people here are early in their career and may not understand who all fit into the hiring process and how so here quick primer the hiring manager is the person in charge of deciding who ultimately get hired of the time this will be the person who manages the candidate being hired the hiring manager is responsible for defining what they want in candidate what they will be doing etc the way they do this is by writing job description which outline the skill and experience person should have a well a what they will be doing the hr comp department will then take job description and grade it decide how much someone in that role should be paid this is the team that say if you want someone with year of experience and grad degree they should get xk year then come your hr business partner a hiring manager you don normally talk to the comp

deep learning with unordered datapoints,have project coming up over the holidays where will probably need to use neural network to find certain patterns in dataset of sports tracking data and coordinate per player some patterns are easy matchable with rule based approach others are quite complicated as patterns are not only still but multiple frames of positions of players will probably need to use lstm layer the part am currently struggling is how to pass the input the right way as can not order players by strong qualitative measurement position or number of player is not meaningful,1,deep learning with unordered datapoints,have project coming up over the holiday where will probably need to use neural network to find certain pattern in dataset of sport tracking data and coordinate per player some pattern are easy matchable with rule based approach others are quite complicated a pattern are not only still but multiple frame of position of player will probably need to use lstm layer the part am currently struggling is how to pas the input the right way a can not order player by strong qualitative measurement position or number of player is not meaningful

beginning to think that the data science job want doesn actually exist,beginning to think that the data science job want doesn actually exist ve had three roles in in the ds industry and ve come to believe that there are three ds archetypes the researcher these are the guys gals who invented fb prophet for example their work is all about amp to bring tool that could support many hypothetically infinite downstream problems and performance on benchmark tasks is emphasized without phd it hard to get considered for these sorts of roles the engineer these are the folks who seldom invent truly novel models but more often train and deploy established models as service they re not inventing the next world class language model they re using transfer learning on bert to build an mlaas product ve had these roles before but find them unsatisfying the answer is almost always more data or better hyperparameter tuning but understanding the inner mechanics of the model takes back seat to knowing how to integrate model into production environment cs heavy which isn my background the statistician these are the data scientists who are interested in understanding the user product ecosystem their output isn deployed model but articulating who what where when amp why their output is tangible and unblocks executives when decision needs to be made my current role by far is most aligned with the statistician archetype ds product analytics at meta my personal interest area is in bayesian statistics find hypothesis testing to be reductionist and view bayesian methods as holistic models that better answer who what where when amp why yet meta has very fast paced impact oriented culture sure could do regression analysis to infer the interaction of age and gender on product usage but it an unspoken rule that discouraged from doing so it preferred that visualize relationships formulate hypothesis and generate some confidence intervals using our experimentation platform nobody cares about quantifying the magnitude of the interaction they re much more binary significant or not decide the cadence is so fast that there isn an appetite for fully bayesian approach feel that my dream job might not exist love to take real problem draw up diagram of relevant variables define model in pymc3 or stan use mcmc simulations and visualize the posterior to better understand who what any thoughts on this do you agree with my archetypes would you add remove modify any and any hints on where might look for the flavor of ds more aligned with my pitch very close to saying it making cash

interested in understanding the user product ecosystem their output isn deployed model but articulating who what where when amp why their output is tangible and unblocks executive when decision need to be made my current role by far is most aligned with the statistician archetype d product analytics at meta my personal interest area is in bayesian statistic find hypothesis testing to be reductionist and view bayesian method a holistic model that better answer who what where when amp why yet meta ha very fast paced impact oriented culture sure could do regression analysis to infer the interaction of age and gender on product usage but it an unspoken rule that discouraged from doing so it preferred that visualize relationship formulate hypothesis and generate some confidence interval using our experimentation platform nobody care about quantifying the magnitude of the interaction they re much more binary significant or not decide the cadence is so fast that there isn an appetite for fully bayesian approach feel that my dream job might not exist love to take real problem draw up diagram of relevant variable define model in pymc3 or stan use mcmc simulation and visualize the posterior to better understand who what any thought on this do you agree with my archetype would you add remove modify any and any hint on where might look for the flavor of d more aligned with my pitch very close to saying it making cash stock at growth company my dream job isn worth giving up good deal
becoming data scientist without degree,am years old have prior experience in the music industry assisting management companies with marketing rollouts and engagement analysis of their artists also have experience in the fashion industry having had brand of my own that was fairly successful always loved programming and the potential to be able to fuse that with critical analyses to strategize new ideas for company and or myself is promising to me have completed the ibm data science professional certificate andrew yang machine learning stanford course amp deep learning course and am currently learning tensorflow am also in the process of building projects of my own to start my resume with all of that being said is it possible in to get position as data scientist without degree have asked several people within the industry if it is possible and they have said yes understand few years ago it didn seem too feasible but now it seems like the narrative has changed and things have progressed to be more accepting of people without degrees just want other honest opinions don want to be naive with solid portfolio and experience under my belt think it is definitely possible thank you for your time and opinions,1,becoming data scientist without degree,am year old have prior experience in the music industry assisting management company with marketing rollouts and engagement analysis of their artist also have experience in the fashion industry having had brand of my own that wa fairly successful always loved programming and the potential to be able to fuse that with critical analysis to strategize new idea for company and or myself is promising to me have completed the ibm data science professional certificate andrew yang machine learning stanford course amp deep learning course and am currently learning tensorflow am also in the process of building project of my own to start my resume with all of that being said is it possible in to get position a data scientist without degree have asked several people within the industry if it is possible and they have said yes understand few year ago it didn seem too feasible but now it seems like the narrative ha changed and thing have progressed to be more accepting of people without degree just want other honest opinion don want to be naive with solid portfolio and experience under my belt think it is definitely possible thank you for your time and opinion

apache dolphinscheduler release announcement workflowascode is launched,amp x200b format png amp auto webp amp ec070bff5a5cfe5c8a90a19f180e16d4104de1e0 amp x200b in the long awaited workflowascode function is finally launched in version as promised bringing good news to users who need to dynamically create and update workflows in batches in addition the new version also adds the wecom alarm group chat message push simplifies the metadata initialization process and fixes issues that existed in the former version such as failure of service restart after forced termination and the failure to add hive data source new function workflowascode first of all in terms of new functions version released pythongatewayserver which is workflow as code server started in the same way as apiserver and other services when pythongatewayserver is enabled all python api requests are sent to pythongatewayserver workflow as code lets users create workflows through the python api which is great news for users who need to create and update workflows dynamically and in batches workflows created with workflow as code can be viewed in the web ui just like other workflows the following is workflow as code test case define workflow properties including name scheduling period start time tenant etc with processdefinition name tutorial schedule start_time tenant tenant_exists as pd define tasks which are all shell tasks the required parameters of shell tasks are task name command information here are all the shell commands of echo task_parent shell name task_parent command echo hello pydolphinscheduler task_child_one shell name task_child_one command echo child one task_child_two shell name task_child_two command echo child two task_union shell name task_union command echo union define dependencies between tasks here task_child_one and task_child_two are first declared as task group through python list task_group task_child_one task_child_two use the set_downstream method to declare the task group task_group as the downstream of task_parent and declare the upstream through set_upstream task_parent set_downstream task_group use the bit operator lt lt to declare the task_union as the downstream of the task_group and support declaration through the bit operator gt gt task_union lt lt task_group when the above code runs you can see workflow in the web ui as follows gt task_child_one task_parent gt gt task_union gt task_child_two wecom alarm mode supports group chat message push in the previous version the wechat alarm only supported the message notification in version when the user uses the wecom alarm it supports pushing the group chat message in the app to the user optimization simplified metadata initialization process when apache dolphinscheduler is first installed running create dolphinscheduler sh requires step by step upgrade from the oldest version to the current version in order to initialize the metadata process more conveniently and quickly version allows users to directly install the current version of the database script which improves the installation speed remove days in complement dates removed the day in the complement date to avoid user confusion when the ui date always displays when the complement is added bug fixes fix logger memory leak in worker compatible with historical version data source connection information memory constraints cause errors when upgrading from to service restart fails after forced termination process definition version create time is wrong failed to execute procedure node add default configuration of quartz and zookeeper in common configuration items in the dependency node an error is reported when there is an option that does not belong to the current project workflow replication error workflow is always running when worker sendresult succeeds but the master does not receive error report h2 in standalone server will automatically restart after few minutes resulting in abnormal data loss error reported when executing mysql table creation statement dependent node retry delay does not work failed to add hive data source download release note thanks as always we would like to

is finally launched in version a promised bringing good news to user who need to dynamically create and update workflow in batch in addition the new version also add the wecom alarm group chat message push simplifies the metadata initialization process and fix issue that existed in the former version such a failure of service restart after forced termination and the failure to add hive data source new function workflowascode first of all in term of new function version released pythongatewayserver which is workflow a code server started in the same way a apiserver and other service when pythongatewayserver is enabled all python api request are sent to pythongatewayserver workflow a code let user create workflow through the python api which is great news for user who need to create and update workflow dynamically and in batch workflow created with workflow a code can be viewed in the web ui just like other workflow the following is workflow a code test case define workflow property including name scheduling period start time tenant etc with processdefinition name tutorial schedule start_time tenant tenant_exists a pd define task which are all shell task the required parameter of shell task are task name command information here are all the shell command of echo task_parent shell name task_parent command echo hello pydolphinscheduler task_child_one shell name task_child_one command echo child one task_child_two shell name task_child_two command echo child two task_union shell name task_union command echo union define dependency between task here task_child_one and task_child_two are first declared a task group through python list task_group task_child_one task_child_two use the set_downstream method to declare the task group task_group a the downstream of task_parent and declare the upstream through set_upstream task_parent set_downstream task_group use the bit operator lt lt to declare the task_union a the downstream of the task_group and support declaration through the bit operator gt gt task_union lt lt task_group when the above code run you can see workflow in the web ui a follows gt task_child_one task_parent gt gt task_union gt task_child_two wecom alarm mode support group chat message push in the previous version the wechat alarm only supported the message notification in version when the user us the wecom alarm it support pushing the group chat message in the app to the user optimization simplified metadata initialization process when apache dolphinscheduler is first installed running create dolphinscheduler sh requires step by step upgrade from the oldest version to the current version in order to initialize the metadata process more conveniently and quickly version allows user to directly install the current version of the database script which improves the installation speed remove day in complement date removed the day in the complement date to avoid user confusion when the ui date always display when the complement is added bug fix fix logger memory leak in worker compatible with historical version data source connection information memory constraint cause error when upgrading from to service restart fails after forced termination process definition version create time is wrong failed to execute procedure node add default configuration of quartz and zookeeper in common configuration item in the dependency node an error is reported when there is an option that doe not belong to the current project workflow replication error workflow is always running when worker sendresult succeeds but the master doe not receive error report h2 in standalone server will automatically restart after few minute resulting in abnormal data loss error reported when executing mysql

pandas coding convention for column naming,hi all interested in hearing the community opinion on some pandas coding convention my problem have to make new columns based on other columns the rules are basically the same so created one function that does this that simple however the new columns need new names that replace the previous suffix for example given df column1_value ll want to name the new column df column1_result simple enough but have ish columns which all would look like df column1_result funct df column1_value except the names are slightly different so in theory can write function that takes the name of the string and returns it with the ending being changed which means can loop instead of declaring each column my intuition is saying don do this anyone have good alternative or real reason why wouldn do this,0,panda coding convention for column naming,hi all interested in hearing the community opinion on some panda coding convention my problem have to make new column based on other column the rule are basically the same so created one function that doe this that simple however the new column need new name that replace the previous suffix for example given df column1_value ll want to name the new column df column1_result simple enough but have ish column which all would look like df column1_result funct df column1_value except the name are slightly different so in theory can write function that take the name of the string and return it with the ending being changed which mean can loop instead of declaring each column my intuition is saying don do this anyone have good alternative or real reason why wouldn do this

fight or flight response for new position,this will be long so ll tl dr at the bottom am trying to get some outside perspective on my career from the sub have been feeling the pressure of my position and it has been triggering flight or fight response from me half of me says to dig in and learn and another part of me says to get out asap and find new path for starters work for the fed began my career in mid shortly after graduating college was hired into rotational management program that lasted months after completing the program took my first official position within marketing but in reporting role this was my first exposure to sql the position had great potential for me to learn how to manipulate data for reporting purposes under great boss but that never happened reorg later and was basically report jockey would run some basic stuff and generate some pre made reports and then send out emails it was extremely easy but was bored and wanted to get into job with real skills that led to me getting job for the data warehousing org was not qualified by any means and they knew that but they were willing to bring me on initially they started me in one of the data marts they told me they wanted me to work on few things but that the primary goal was to get trained and learn development now there was essentially no onboarding no training no real guidance at all sat at my desk for weeks months with nothing was trying to get grasp but the world of development has so many facets and with the layer of government red tape over every process was at loss after few months and another reorg later land on different team within the same org now am handling audits and agile pm work no development after the better part of year of doing that end up in temporary assignment as developer on different team now this is related to the first position had but very different in terms of what tools they used and the processes they used to promote the code changes however have manager who knows my situation and was great with working with me and giving me projects could do early on wasn treated as full on dev since the position was temporary but was promoting code and learning well that lasted handful of months and fell off to not having much work well what do you know another reorg big one our whole organization was wiped and rebranded full on top down reorg was not selected early on to lateral into the equivalent position in the new org from march sept was unassigned still had to sign on join some meetings but had no work and nothing to do the manager of my

didn want to change again have now been on this team since oct have roughly months of actual dev work and am in full on data engineer role have inherited applications that originated in the early and

using debit card with lt balance in aws,planning to play with aws little meaning there alot of uncertainties and lot of unexpected charges that might occur as far as my research goes aws budget could only alert you when the threshold for specific service has been breached but it not really going to do much more planning to use debit card with very low amount of balance so when things go wrong they couldn charge me anymore as it doesn contain enough money ve tried searching but haven seen anyone who done the same now getting paranoid whether what wrong with my idea can anyone point it out,0,using debit card with lt balance in aws,planning to play with aws little meaning there alot of uncertainty and lot of unexpected charge that might occur a far a my research go aws budget could only alert you when the threshold for specific service ha been breached but it not really going to do much more planning to use debit card with very low amount of balance so when thing go wrong they couldn charge me anymore a it doesn contain enough money ve tried searching but haven seen anyone who done the same now getting paranoid whether what wrong with my idea can anyone point it out

being constantly shut down by more senior team members when mention adding some qa in our work,so am consultant still junior that is put on project where we are building dashboard application for our client we are team of data engineers data architect data strategy consultant don know actual role name data modellers analysts solution owner on the engineering side we are people engineers data architect strategy guy that are building data pipelines according to data modeller requirements for their consumption am quite concerned with quality of work we are producing had to push so we can investigate and then set up local aws glue environment so we dont have to actually use the gui on aws to manually run the pipelines every time we are developing them now feel like am pushing for having some sort of testing standards in place so we can test our pipelines ve been drawn in so many meetings where data architect needs to debug his code and he asks me to help to rewrite his spark logic in sql so he can check where are the mistakes like isn this the reason you want to write automated tests where you can test for crap like this using some representative dummy data everytime mention something about writing black box tests for our pipeline am being dismissed that this would nice to have and they appreciate my idea but we should focus on development work first and getting pipelines going as this is our priority the problem with this approach is that once we finish somewhat worki pipeline we jump onto next pipeline development task and this is considered done now ve been given task to write pipeline from s3 to redshift where need to parse some nested jsons at the moment only have dummy data of records asked if we can get file that specifies what sort of data we are expecting in records because many fields contain nulls so want to know whether it will contain arrays dictionaries strings was dismissed and told that this is not important when more data comes in we will just infer schema from that and should focus on task at hand and should work with what have records like am being too anal by asking if we can somehow find out from data providers what data formats will be there so know what table format should create in redshift don know have only yoe and feel this is definitely not how data engineering should be done am worried about the quality of work we are producing as well as am not learning the best engineering practices here know solution owner is on the same page with me and the other data engineer as well but any talks about quality checks following more agile practices are being shut down by data architect and big data strategy consultant will try my best to lead by example already showed how testing can be done locally will develop my pipeline with appropriate unit tests and black box tests for my pipeline hopefully this will convince more senior guys that this is not that difficult to do and it adds value my rant is

how would you select the architecture and design pipeline for this type of problem included below,this is not some assignment question dealing with this at work and want to get some opinions on how others would handle it ingest unstructured data from single rd party data source let say million rows documents different tables collections some preliminary transformation like mapping custom field names to consistent internal ones date time formatting and so on and then putting it into db data store couple of potentially long running jobs depends on querying external apis which may have their own throttling limits to be run on every single document from above but only on of the tables collections so about million rows this is run only once every week or so new fields are added from the result of the api queries job where some pretrained dl models are ran against the rows for tables say about new fields are added per row after the inferences at the end some aggregation happens and new table is created where every row document is collection of sub documents from other collections this point is important another job where the newly created table is processed and bunch of new fields are created for every single subdoc upto per subdocument some of this processing also involves running ml dl models on the docs there are also training steps in the middle where some models need to train if there are enough data or enough time has passed let just say monthly training at the end of this job the contents of this new table is again aggregated based on one of the fields let say doc_owner and put into another table this is the actual data that is useful for the customer this data maybe fields wide job where the finally created data is exported to the customer preferred warehouse db store eg firebase snowflake bigtable my question is how would approach such problem what tools would you use for each step,0,how would you select the architecture and design pipeline for this type of problem included below,this is not some assignment question dealing with this at work and want to get some opinion on how others would handle it ingest unstructured data from single rd party data source let say million row document different table collection some preliminary transformation like mapping custom field name to consistent internal one date time formatting and so on and then putting it into db data store couple of potentially long running job depends on querying external apis which may have their own throttling limit to be run on every single document from above but only on of the table collection so about million row this is run only once every week or so new field are added from the result of the api query job where some pretrained dl model are ran against the row for table say about new field are added per row after the inference at the end some aggregation happens and new table is created where every row document is collection of sub document from other collection this point is important another job where the newly created table is processed and bunch of new field are created for every single subdoc upto per subdocument some of this processing also involves running ml dl model on the doc there are also training step in the middle where some model need to train if there are enough data or enough time ha passed let just say monthly training at the end of this job the content of this new table is again aggregated based on one of the field let say doc_owner and put into another table this is the actual data that is useful for the customer this data maybe field wide job where the finally created data is exported to the customer preferred warehouse db store eg firebase snowflake bigtable my question is how would approach such problem what tool would you use for each step

predictions for the modern data stack in,we wrote this article with our predictions for the modern data stack in in summary these are the main trends that we think we will see in the next year the metrics layer is here on oct of drew banin shook up the data world with his pr titled dbt should know about metrics with that announcement dbt became the front runner to win the race towards the data os the implementation of the metric layer will be major factor in making data accessible to more types of users this is very exciting announcement and will make it easier for companies to leverage data for business intelligence by improving the ease of creating queries and dashboards the new data workspace will emerge the way we read share and consume information has changed drastically over the years and it has the potential to continue to do so in the future therefore an all in one data workspace tool may be solution that responds not only to the needs of data teams today but also to how stakeholders consume data tomorrow the reverse etl race heats up stakeholders outside of the data team are becoming more data literate and in doing so are starting to require different set of tools to work with data this is partially why the reverse etl space has become one of the fastest growing data categories one of the primary predictions is that open source reverse etl will reach the same adoption as both hightouch and census in in the reverse etl space this may seem like bold claim but one that we feel is backed by substantial evidence based on what has taken shape in the etl space in addition to the increased competition in the reverse etl space we believe that we could see major acquisition in this space from larger company like twilio or fivetran the synergies between reverse etl and etl are predictive models are coming extremely excited about how predictions are going to start improving the accuracy of metrics in the modern data stack continual is one company that is making it easy to maintain predictions from customer churn to inventory forecasts directly in your cloud data warehouse this approach makes me feel confident that predictive analytics and machine learning will continue to grow in popularity within the modern data stack as it continues to become easier to implement data operations takes shape ironically data teams frequently don have the information to help us to make decisions and take action in data driven way we need data about the data we provide to make decisions about this data also called metadata for example which tables are being relied upon the most by end users what is the business definition of this metric are any etl pipelines delayed answers to these sorts of questions are increasingly important as data is becoming product used beyond simple reporting to power wide surface area of applications the operations around data are almost as important as the data itself but most teams today are building products without process documentation monitoring or analytics in summary we believe the future of the modern data stack will continue to make it easier than ever to extract even more value from your data it an

how to deal with number type in javascript,hello everyone in our company the backend teams use combination of nodejs and mongodb apparently in js there is data type named number and this data type can be both doubletype and integertype and they write data in mongodb the problem is we in data engineer team when we want to sync the data from mongodb to hdfs using spark we sometimes face different data types and change of schema in fields that their types are number because in spark doubletype and integertype are two different things but in js and mongodb there is no difference between them don know what is the best approach to this problem but came up with solution that we consider all number types as doubletype when syncing data so we can avoid such changes in the future want to know pros and cons of this solution and if you know any better approach to this problem please let me know thank you all in advance,0,how to deal with number type in javascript,hello everyone in our company the backend team use combination of nodejs and mongodb apparently in j there is data type named number and this data type can be both doubletype and integertype and they write data in mongodb the problem is we in data engineer team when we want to sync the data from mongodb to hdfs using spark we sometimes face different data type and change of schema in field that their type are number because in spark doubletype and integertype are two different thing but in j and mongodb there is no difference between them don know what is the best approach to this problem but came up with solution that we consider all number type a doubletype when syncing data so we can avoid such change in the future want to know pro and con of this solution and if you know any better approach to this problem please let me know thank you all in advance
advice for how to hire de intern,fairly new de yoe and received permission to bring on an intern this summer the main goal would be getting me experience teaching and managing people and hopefully to find someone that we could hire full time next year the only person in the firm wearing the de swe hat right now have some idea of what traits would want in hire namely curious enjoys programming and understanding how things work under the hood do not expect an intern to know jack shit and will probably just ask candidates to do fizzbuzz and talk about projects they ve done in the interview amp x200b while hardly seasoned veteran ve been growing into the role quite well have working data warehouse with solid logging and exception handling that hasn broken after months of daily pipeline runs and expect further growth in the months between now and when the intern would start thinking ll probably spin up cloned warehouse environment with the pii stripped out this is an investment firm so replacing client names with list of baby names or just numbers won affect data quality in meaningful way give them copy of ddia to read over the summer and have them work through some of the problems ve worked to solve that would give them real experience and provide way to familiarize them with the stack and databases basically going to treat this as learning experience for them rather than try to shove grunt work or busywork at them and feel good about myself amp x200b so with that in mind and the fact that ideally we could recruit some talent into the firm afterwards what do you think should be looking for asking for in the posting and interview process also hate the way most technical roles are hired currently and will fucking die on this hill if have to in order to make it better

language the foundation of learning your first language is what matters not intimate knowledge of the idiosyncrasies of python ability to pass fizzbuzz with numbers other than and it would be nice if they knew sql but let be honest it not that hard to learn and the only way to actually get good at it is to use it rising senior smart person who gets things done amp x200b yeah that pretty much it we

leaving faang after only months,apologize for the clickbaity title but wanted to make post that hopefully provides some insight for anyone looking to become de in faang like company know for many people that the dream and for good reason meta was fantastic company to work for it just wasn for me ve attempted to explain why below it just metrics person that really enjoys working with data early in its lifecycle closer to the collection processing and storage phases however des at meta and from what ve heard all faang like companies are involved much later in that lifecycle in the analysis and visualization stages in my opinion des at faang are actually analytics engineers and lot of the work you ll do will involve building dashboards tweaking metrics and maintaining pipelines that have already been built because the company data infra is so mature there not lot of pioneering work to be done so if you re looking to build_ something you might have better luck at smaller company it all tables lot of the data at meta is generated in house by the products that they ve developed this means that any data generated or collected is made available through the logs which are then parsed and stored in tables there are no apis to connect to csvs to ingest or tools that need to be connected so they can share data it just tables the pipelines that parse the logs have for the most part already been built and thus your job as de is to work with the tables that are created every night found this incredibly boring because get more joy satisfaction out of working with really dirty raw data that where feel can add value but data at meta is already pretty clean just due to the nature of how it generated and collected if your joy satisfaction comes from helping data scientists make the most of the data that available then faang is definitely for you but if you get your satisfaction from making unusable data usable then this likely isn what you re looking for it the wrong kind of scale think one of the appeals to working as de in faang is that there is just so much data the idea of working with petabytes of data brings thoughts of how to work at such large scale and it all sounds really exciting that was certainly the case for me the problem though is that this has all pretty much been solved in faang and it being solved by swes not des distributed computing hyper efficient query engines load balancing etc are all implemented by swes and so working at scale means implementing basic common sense in your sql queries so that you re not going over the gb memory limit on any given node much prefer breadth over depth when it comes to scale much rather work with large variety of data types solving large variety of problems faang doesn provide this at least not in my experience can feel the impact lot of the work you do as data engineer is related to metrics and dashboards with the goal of helping the data scientists use the data more effectively for me this

of faang was great company to work at with lot of really important and interesting work being done but for me as data engineer it just wasn my thing wanted to put this all out there for those who

elt database in aws leaning towards aurora serverless postgresql anything to beware,sorry for the long post just trying to share all the relevant info for our issue at hand overview we are using python to ingest music data from across the web this includes handful of web scrapers as well as data ingestion from different data apis our data pipelines are batch and we are orchestrating things using self managed apache airflow run with docker on an ec2 instance the data ingested will be displayed in the front end of our mern stack app some additional info relative to how big data gets our data is not too big we anticipate the entire database to be gb in size over the next few years our data is relational in music data we have tables for artists songs albums etc songs belong to albums and artists and albums belong to artists we are following elt framework rather than etl and so there may be some transformations to the data after loading into the database all in all we do not have too many transformations and the ones we do have are fairly basic linear combinations of the data we are working within aws ecosystem and need to determine which production database to use here is where my mind is currently we need relational database so not any of the non relational databases so no to dynamodb no to elasticache we need to prioritize fast reads by our node api not fast analytical transformations it seems we need an application database not an analytical database so no to redshift it seems our remaining options are rds postgresql rds mysql rds aurora postgresql or mysql rds aurora serverless postgres or rds the decision between postgresql vs mysql seems like matter of preference and am fairly neutral on the two of these options assuming we go with postgresql am then stuck between rds postgresql rds aurora postgresql and rds aurora serverless postgresql the main full stack dev on our team is encouraging us to use rds aurora serverless postgresql my main question then are is there anything to beware with aurora serverless postgresql for elt is it challenging or doable to build data pipelines with python amp airflow that insert data into aurora serverless postgresql can we easily load data from an s3 bucket into aurora serverless postgresql how challenging is it to incorporate aurora serverless postgresql into our apache airflow project

how to connect central fact table to datasets,hi question about database design am creating database that stores many datasets and have central fact table that just has the unique names of the datasets the problem is cannot find way to connect the actual datasets to the fact table for example have dataset unistudents that has the name imaginary unistudents but the actual unistudents dataset has columns student_id student_name and program is there logical way to connect them the central fact table and unistudents table could create fictional column in the unistudents dataset so it would be table unistudent with columns student_id student_name program and dataset_name with value imaginary unistudents but that would create rather redundant column for example dataset name with only one value imaginary unistudents everywhere is there better more logical way to do it,0,how to connect central fact table to datasets,hi question about database design am creating database that store many datasets and have central fact table that just ha the unique name of the datasets the problem is cannot find way to connect the actual datasets to the fact table for example have dataset unistudents that ha the name imaginary unistudents but the actual unistudents dataset ha column student_id student_name and program is there logical way to connect them the central fact table and unistudents table could create fictional column in the unistudents dataset so it would be table unistudent with column student_id student_name program and dataset_name with value imaginary unistudents but that would create rather redundant column for example dataset name with only one value imaginary unistudents everywhere is there better more logical way to do it

advice on encrypting sensitive ids that result in values that are secure but still user friendly best practice,we need to leverage account ids in our reporting layer but those ids are sensitive so they need to be encrypted tokenized our footprint is small less than million values token lookups seem like lot of overhead and prefer to not have lookup table with the keys to the kingdom in it encryption seems like the best option especially since we can use different salts for different contexts ex if we need to share data with multiple vendors the ids wouldn map back and we have existing security infrastructure to manage that but the guids we get back from secure encryption are long and not human friendly and humans will be using these is there best practice for masking ids programmatically and globally my initial thought is to double dip the ids use strong encryption initially and then use weak encryption to resolve that to something more readable would be fine including both values in our tables to account for data loss in that process surely this is thing people have dealt with before is there tried amp true solution,0,advice on encrypting sensitive id that result in value that are secure but still user friendly best practice,we need to leverage account id in our reporting layer but those id are sensitive so they need to be encrypted tokenized our footprint is small le than million value token lookup seem like lot of overhead and prefer to not have lookup table with the key to the kingdom in it encryption seems like the best option especially since we can use different salt for different context ex if we need to share data with multiple vendor the id wouldn map back and we have existing security infrastructure to manage that but the guids we get back from secure encryption are long and not human friendly and human will be using these is there best practice for masking id programmatically and globally my initial thought is to double dip the id use strong encryption initially and then use weak encryption to resolve that to something more readable would be fine including both value in our table to account for data loss in that process surely this is thing people have dealt with before is there tried amp true solution

advice on creating data warehouse in an old school business that doesn have much of data culture yet,hi everyone be interested to see what those more experienced than me would do in my situation currently one of three analysts in pretty old school business logistics they ve only just created an analytics department over the past years so there are no data engineers and doubt management would believe that that even real job title ve taught myself sql and python and am pretty confident with both more so python than sql spend most of my time creating reports in powerbi this is where ve started noticing issues namely amp x200b we build the reports based on data straight from our oltp databases on prem sql server know this isn best practise and could cause performance issues down the track already sometimes crash the servers if my queries are too heavy there data inconsistency between reports depending on who made it or how it built for example ve built out our amp with whole lot of tiny transformations excluding this gl including this department but not if it from this site etc which sits in dataset for that particular report if ever want to reference back to say revenue for particular period in another report then have to completely replicate the logic ve built into the amp report dataset otherwise those figures will never match this is causing those who rely on those numbers to lose confidence in the data know that if anyone else ever tried to maintain the reports ve built there that many small and subtle transformations that take place for every single dataset that it be close to impossible for them to understand unless they knew the data inside and out let alone make changes to without breaking the report eg if you forget to filter for customer field3 in this particular table you re actually included deleted transactions which is incorrect and therefore won match any of the other reports we definitely have use case for external data already scraping some data from the web that is really useful but have no where to put it because don have write access to our sql server dbs also understand that chucking it into an oltp db probably isn the best move anyway and that it don want people poking around the dbs we use for our applications so am currently just keeping the data on postgres db ve set up on my local machine ve come to the conclusion that considering these issues data warehouse would probably be step in the right direction this will consolidate all of the data from all of the different dbs and there would be single source of truth as bonus really keen on moving my career towards data engineering if can so thought this would be good if not very ambitious project to take on assuming can sell management on it ve done some reading and initially thought okay looks like the tools everyone using is some combination of an orchestration tool first thought is airflow data warehouse snowflake and staging storage area for the data to initially land s3 ve had play around with this exact stack and while it awesome to see how it all works have feeling it way overkill for what we need and that most of what reading is from this sub and most of you guys are probably working with lot more data than we would be for context ve looked at our main dbs and the entire contents of them add up to lt gb also battling with the fact that personally would probably prefer to use airflow cloud products simply to gain experience in these tools to open up further employment opportunities in the future in the data engineering space would

helping with recommendations on products to buy on amazon search function on amazon is an example of data product without well catalogued data this function would be useless scalability scalability is generally defined as the ability of the application to scale in light of changing increasing demands in de this could mean the datawarehouse or datalake platforms could also mean creating scalable data pipelines there are many ways of scaling database datawarehouse for example indexing table would allow fast retrieval of information as your query would not need to search every row of data this would be simple change for significant benefits another scalability example is number database sharding partitioning performance improvement technique of breaking up large data sets into small subsets sharding is when this break up of data set happens across multiple machines partitioning is when this break up of data set happens on the singular database the point is if the data is divided into smaller subsets and into different machines you are not bottlenecking the same machine with your queries each time parting thoughts this is the final post in the series hope you all enjoyed reading

data could mean anything from simple dashboard to ml model helping with recommendation on product to buy on amazon search function on amazon is an example of data product without well catalogued data this function would be useless scalability scalability is generally defined a the ability of the application to scale in light of changing increasing demand in de this could mean the datawarehouse or datalake platform could also mean creating scalable data pipeline there are many way of scaling database datawarehouse for example indexing table would allow fast retrieval of information a your query would not need to search every row of data this would be simple change for significant benefit another scalability example is number database sharding partitioning performance improvement technique of breaking up large data set into small subset sharding is when this break up of data set happens across multiple machine partitioning is when this break up of data set happens on the singular database the point is if the data is divided into smaller subset and into different machine you are not bottlenecking the same machine with your query each time parting thought this is the final post in the series hope you all enjoyed reading this a much a enjoyed writing it also hope you at least learnt few new term it certainly helped me clarify my thinking thanks also to everyone that took part in the comment and helped me improve some of these definition various people have posted the original medium link of this article where usually write so feel free to check that out let me know what else you like to learn and could write up future series about it thank you is here utm_medium web2x amp context is here is here is here
handling dynamic structure in during data ingestion py,hello ve run into some interesting scenario where we have data coming from certain source and have finished ingesting billion records out of after billion records it was observed one of the columns which didn have any data during sampling came up with list data type from the source as result the data ingested has to be exploded after the job is finished was thinking if anyone here has implemented any type of intelligence within their code so that it when it sees list type or nested data json it explodes based on the incoming data amp x200b thanks,0,handling dynamic structure in during data ingestion py,hello ve run into some interesting scenario where we have data coming from certain source and have finished ingesting billion record out of after billion record it wa observed one of the column which didn have any data during sampling came up with list data type from the source a result the data ingested ha to be exploded after the job is finished wa thinking if anyone here ha implemented any type of intelligence within their code so that it when it see list type or nested data json it explodes based on the incoming data amp x200b thanks

how do you develop and test your etl aws glue pipelines,long story short am very new to de and am working on project as consultant with other consultant engineers we are very new team and we definitely don have set standards agreement on the development process we are developing pipelines in glue studio using interactive ui where we are transforming external redshift table so s3 source to s3 sink the production code will sit in repo where ci cd pipeline will push the code the prod environment we are thinking of setting up local aws environment so we don have to use glue ui because this is expensive for the client as each code iteration is run manually takes ages to execute each glue job doesn feel right to use interractive ui tool which lacks many features what your typical ide would have gt leads to inefficient development unable to run unittes overall is crap dev experience want to set up local environment and already found docker image that lets you imitate aws glue service with aws specific spark functions my question is how would you test your etl code in my mind want to mock s3 and other aws service functionality so can run the code completely locally but there seems to be disagreement how we should test our etl pipeline and people don seem to like my idea of unit testing and mocking services some guys want to manually test as you go where you actually read some chunk of data from s3 and then execute aws glue job which runs locally on your machine using docker image their reasoning is that this way the code will remain exactly the same which really dont understand if you follow tdd then unittests and mocking services dont modify your actual code they sit in seperate file so no refactoring is needed for your code when you push it to production as long as all your tests pass is it normal to develop etl code where you test and debug it by running the code manually where you actually call real services want to understand if am being too anal by pushing everyone to write unit tests where we mock the aws services authentification s3 spark instead of manually doing this,0,how do you develop and test your etl aws glue pipeline,long story short am very new to de and am working on project a consultant with other consultant engineer we are very new team and we definitely don have set standard agreement on the development process we are developing pipeline in glue studio using interactive ui where we are transforming external redshift table so s3 source to s3 sink the production code will sit in repo where ci cd pipeline will push the code the prod environment we are thinking of setting up local aws environment so we don have to use glue ui because this is expensive for the client a each code iteration is run manually take age to execute each glue job doesn feel right to use interractive ui tool which lack many feature what your typical ide would have gt lead to inefficient development unable to run unittes overall is crap dev experience want to set up local environment and already found docker image that let you imitate aws glue service with aws specific spark function my question is how would you test your etl code in my mind want to mock s3 and other aws service functionality so can run the code completely locally but there seems to be disagreement how we should test our etl pipeline and people don seem to like my idea of unit testing and mocking service some guy want to manually test a you go where you actually read some chunk of data from s3 and then execute aws glue job which run locally on your machine using docker image their reasoning is that this way the code will remain exactly the same which really dont understand if you follow tdd then unittests and mocking service dont modify your actual code they sit in seperate file so no refactoring is needed for your code when you push it to production a long a all your test pas is it normal to develop etl code where you test and debug it by running the code manually where you actually call real service want to understand if am being too anal by pushing everyone to write unit test where we mock the aws service authentification s3 spark instead of manually doing this

just got fired,entry level offshore remote bucks an hour contract signed an nda and am not mentioning any name of the company or confidential or any specific information so know am good if the client comes across this and is bitter and wants to have fight about this he has my email so joined this remote startup they wanted to hire fullstack developer but begged and convinced my way into python data engineering role they had me on probation for week period day during the onboarding interview was given simple task where needed to generate two analytics table each time they made request to saturate their database post analysis was told that all needed to run main py and everything is ready to go they have some helper documentation on the readme day so get started and things start to go south first they didn assign me with access permissions to the cloud waste some time figuring that out then the docker file shows that need to setup registry stuff so can setup the machine learning models that took some while to figure that out also needed to setup config dot files for that that doesn work at this moment have spent day but logged around half hours the senior dev was helpful but he was super busy the client comes back and gets mad as all needed to run the main py file and that was supposed to be it said we were trying to set up docker for the python version the machine learning libraries and python packages he says run the requirement file the machine learning libraries calls the database processes and sends it back needed to create an analytics log in the middle of that day weekend if you use multiple python versions in project the requirements txt installation using pip installing isn exactly straightforward after hours of trying to figure this out discover that they were using two versions of python and for the requirements file they used one package that wasn supported by the python version they recommended me change the version of that package and finally installed the packages this might sound like an easy fix but urge to try this out day run the file it doesn work of course because this entire repo heavily depends on the docker file and docker file sets up aliases for certain api calls the file will never work straight try my best to discover my way through the jungle that is that codebase and even still get permission issues get one permission issue which was sorted and the entire file doesn run anyway because wasn granted full permission of something say am not getting stuff done and the client gets mad he says that my skills aren that strong as have indicated in my interview how the heck am supposed to react to that said please re read our conversation how am supposed to solve this issue without permission and configuration issues ironed out in the begging of the project they have provided the schema for the analytics they needed so it should be an easy task said can provide code but will be working be working blind they said have all the necessary things for me to get the job done based on schema alone comment out the sections that doesn work and write code that outputs csv at this moment let the client know let me know when should leave they indicate it is going to happen and they said what do you mean by re reading our conversation day today intentionally didn reply to what meant by re reading thread yeah bad thing to say but what am supposed to say when the client thinks am not getting things done while simultaneously locking me out from the very place need to get things done and moreover questioning my skill just felt bad to me comment out sections of code to find what is going on they are simultaneously fetching and merging data to aggregate data upon layers upon layers with

get the message pack your things and go overall logged about hours for this but set their on idle about double that time and obviously didn get paid of the two task did the first one took me minutes

delta transaction log for non parquet data,curious how difficult it would be to create delta log for non parquet data specifically for lots of blob data images or audio etc delta log is quite good but just don like that it turns image files that would be in directories like images cat img002 png images dog img356 png into gt parquet part0002 parquet the original structure is of course retrievable but it obscures the ability to be able to just look at what data is there unless you run an operation that writes back out from the parquet data or something just using md5 hashes timestamps and transaction audits would it really be so difficult to come up with system that works as well without needing to use parquet,0,delta transaction log for non parquet data,curious how difficult it would be to create delta log for non parquet data specifically for lot of blob data image or audio etc delta log is quite good but just don like that it turn image file that would be in directory like image cat img002 png image dog img356 png into gt parquet part0002 parquet the original structure is of course retrievable but it obscures the ability to be able to just look at what data is there unless you run an operation that writes back out from the parquet data or something just using md5 hash timestamps and transaction audit would it really be so difficult to come up with system that work a well without needing to use parquet

advice on current data stack and ways to improve,hi everyone working on trying to improve our data stack and any advices study buddy or mentorship is highly appreciated to give some background the first data engineer for the company coming from front end developer background comfortable with advanced sql stuff and beginner python before me was bi developer who created data models and dashes in sisense on prem which is what use now as well current state of my teams data requirements are coming from our mysql db which is maintained by our software dev team any current api ingestion is done by them and stored in tables we do have an analytical db which has views and queries from our main oltp db the sizes of data here are around rows of orders member transactional data remainder of the data is excel csv files some are static some are updated from time to time by other members of the org we ingest the data into sisense and build data model transformations can be done either in the olap db or the model itself the models are then scheduled to built at certain intervals some take few seconds and the biggest ones around hours which is then accessed by sisense to create the dashboards and email reports we do have data scientist who is doing his work in bigquery though have absolutely have no collaboration with him and no idea what he is doing as well not saying won collaborate with him just that haven reached out yet since this modernization task doing is just research preparing for the final proposal to higher ups lastly in terms of ecosystem our company uses lot of microsoft services as well what envisioning to use and reasons please understand don have real experience on these tools this is more on research and basing my judgement on comparison articles guides some tuts did cloud solution snowflake on azure or azure synapse already in microsoft ecosystem and integration to tools is easier and recommendation to higher ups split on the two because snowflake seems to be easier to implement note the only one who will be doing this on top of other tasks so it balance of ease and delivery of requirements if ever would go for azure synapse will be utilizing tools in their ecosystem bi solution sisense since we re already using it just now it will get data from the dw or if ever can use power bi amp x200b airflow don think would be needing this because you could schedule jobs already in azure data factory fivetran don believe need this for now basing on my current data sources but can anticipate in the future api integration role could be moved from software

data engineering vs data science,heyy soooo im sure this is very common question here so sorry in avance if it is but would love some clarification from much more experienced people like you guys that might have missed through just googling my question is more focused on the starter and education side of things as in what does an aspiring data engineer do learn compared to data scientist feel data engineering would suit me much better but all my knowledge comes from the data science side of things are both fields very similar to each other when it comes to learning and its only once you get job that you are given the title as engineer or scientist like the roadmap towards becoming one or the other are similar at the moment short version of my roadmap was looking like this take data science bootcamp get starters job in the field while continuing into an engineering degree at my uni what changes should make or add thanks in advance everyone this would be such life saver,0,data engineering v data science,heyy soooo im sure this is very common question here so sorry in avance if it is but would love some clarification from much more experienced people like you guy that might have missed through just googling my question is more focused on the starter and education side of thing a in what doe an aspiring data engineer do learn compared to data scientist feel data engineering would suit me much better but all my knowledge come from the data science side of thing are both field very similar to each other when it come to learning and it only once you get job that you are given the title a engineer or scientist like the roadmap towards becoming one or the other are similar at the moment short version of my roadmap wa looking like this take data science bootcamp get starter job in the field while continuing into an engineering degree at my uni what change should make or add thanks in advance everyone this would be such life saver
advice for syncing postgres database with timescaledb database,work at company where we store the majority of our data in several postgresql databases some of our data is in the form of time series we re in the process of trying to improve query performance and after doing some benchmarking with timescaledb ve found it would be much more efficient than the other methods ve tried with just postgres by itself at previous company we used kafka to sync two databases that stored similar data that needed to be slightly reformatted before being inserted into the destination db considering using kafka in this scenario as well to sync the data from postgres to the timescaledb we re on aws so can simply just install the timescaledb extension to the existing host unfortunately does anyone know of any alternatives to kafka to keep postgres host and timescaledb host in sync ve found documentation on streaming replication for timescaledb but that seems to only be for the source replica architecture,0,advice for syncing postgres database with timescaledb database,work at company where we store the majority of our data in several postgresql database some of our data is in the form of time series we re in the process of trying to improve query performance and after doing some benchmarking with timescaledb ve found it would be much more efficient than the other method ve tried with just postgres by itself at previous company we used kafka to sync two database that stored similar data that needed to be slightly reformatted before being inserted into the destination db considering using kafka in this scenario a well to sync the data from postgres to the timescaledb we re on aws so can simply just install the timescaledb extension to the existing host unfortunately doe anyone know of any alternative to kafka to keep postgres host and timescaledb host in sync ve found documentation on streaming replication for timescaledb but that seems to only be for the source replica architecture

steps to managing and prioritizing data requests free template included,as an early data hire at fast growing company one of the first things that you ll likely encounter is backlog of questions from employees this backlog alongside all the other tasks associated with reporting maintaining data and creating new pipelines can feel extremely overwhelming these long lists of tasks and questions prevent many data teams from being proactive about analysis without proper process in place that allows analysts to enable self service managing data requests proactively can feel like never ending battle against current additionally data teams that constantly need to answer the same question are not creating processes that help them manage the scale and complexity that companies experience as they grow below are some of our tips on how to manage the data requests backlog we believe that great data teams should be proactive they should adopt tools and processes that ensure that the data team never has to answer the same question twice we hope this step by step list is helpful to all data teams that want to improve their efficiency and reduce their workload in the future set expectations about the data requests workflow with reasonable timelines the first step of setting expectations around team is communicating the way that your team is working to the stakeholders in the company we suggest adopting an agile workflow with weekly or bi weekly sprints although your scrum team may be small at first setting expectations about when certain requests will be answered with the sprint methodology can be helpful with scrum product is built in series of iterations called sprints that break down big complex projects into bite sized pieces define your requests workflow data requests are questions that employees have about data that exists in the organization or about new data that isn being collected yet traditionally data teams will take data requests through an intake form or slack channel where employees can ask for the request some of the requests are unique and difficult questions which require the full attention of the data team on the other hand some data requests are repetitive and low priority which doesn require much effort from the data team create requests template we ve created data requests template for teams that are looking for better way to manage inbound questions below is the template feel free to copy the template and use it in your team workflow here our template what is the business question you are trying to answer what is the impact of this question and how will it help the company who will be using this data what time frames are crucial here example monthly weekly daily what is the visualization you are trying to create what interactions drill downs are required ie the type of use revenue amount etc are there any other details we should know about this data request automate repetitive data requests data teams that take the next step with their data requests process can start to think proactively about data requests customer support teams have been deflecting inbound questions for years using tools like intercoms knowledge base and ada automated customer support chatbots smart data teams realize that they can do the same data teams can automate and deflect common questions with tools that allow them to document data requests in the same place teammates are looking for answers measure the data requests workflow lastly you can improve anything you don measure taking the time to measure what your

how does normalization increase performance,reading up on normalization vs denormalization it keeps coming up that normalizing your data reduces redundancy and increases performance the reduces redundancy understand but the example in my mind is web log and don see how normalizing this data would increase performance you may get location ip address date and time page requested os and browser information from weblog if you normalize this data you might make date table time table browser table and an os table if you made these separate tables and made them foreign keys in the fact table web log table wouldn that significantly slow down the performance of writing the data you would need to parse the log lookup the value for the date time os and browser create them if they don exist and then construct row for the fact table with the updated row containing the foreign keys could someone provide concrete example of when how normalization speeds up performance,0,how doe normalization increase performance,reading up on normalization v denormalization it keep coming up that normalizing your data reduces redundancy and increase performance the reduces redundancy understand but the example in my mind is web log and don see how normalizing this data would increase performance you may get location ip address date and time page requested o and browser information from weblog if you normalize this data you might make date table time table browser table and an o table if you made these separate table and made them foreign key in the fact table web log table wouldn that significantly slow down the performance of writing the data you would need to parse the log lookup the value for the date time o and browser create them if they don exist and then construct row for the fact table with the updated row containing the foreign key could someone provide concrete example of when how normalization speed up performance

smart solution to reduce an impractical number of iterations in time series model,hello folks know this might not be the most appropriate sub for this discussion but no harm in trying right we have timeseries based ml solution that helps with anomaly detection and finding the root cause for this anomaly how it currently operates is if see an anomaly in metric if the actual is far from prediction we try to examine the associated dimensions and associate the anomaly to its root cause accordingly for example considering covid related deaths across the us if our model senses an anomaly steep rise fall we try to break down the available data by state and see which state is responsible for such steep change in this example there is only one dimension which is the state so our model in essence iterates over states hence iterations when we try to scale this up to multivariate that involves for example dimensions to the already existing state say we add gender age group income group health rating the number of iterations is going to explode what was earlier is now going to become states genders income groups health ratings iterations when such model has to detect anomalies in say commerce data where the number of dimensions is going to be larger hope you see how can our model scale at least without parallelization how do you guys think can we solve this any suggestion is greatly appreciated thanks,0,smart solution to reduce an impractical number of iteration in time series model,hello folk know this might not be the most appropriate sub for this discussion but no harm in trying right we have timeseries based ml solution that help with anomaly detection and finding the root cause for this anomaly how it currently operates is if see an anomaly in metric if the actual is far from prediction we try to examine the associated dimension and associate the anomaly to it root cause accordingly for example considering covid related death across the u if our model sens an anomaly steep rise fall we try to break down the available data by state and see which state is responsible for such steep change in this example there is only one dimension which is the state so our model in essence iterates over state hence iteration when we try to scale this up to multivariate that involves for example dimension to the already existing state say we add gender age group income group health rating the number of iteration is going to explode what wa earlier is now going to become state gender income group health rating iteration when such model ha to detect anomaly in say commerce data where the number of dimension is going to be larger hope you see how can our model scale at least without parallelization how do you guy think can we solve this any suggestion is greatly appreciated thanks

scaling airflow with celery cluster using docker swarm,as the title says want to setup airflow that would run on cluster master nodes using docker swarm current setup right now have airflow setup that

successfully pivoted from etl bi developer to data engineer in seattle wanted to share my experience,ve been posting in here occasionally about my journey to becoming real data engineer would get lot of messages about what did in my journey how currently doing so thought would share with everyone background worked for fortune company in texas had the data engineer title in my previous role but was really an etl bi developer realized had an inflated job title was getting paid lot for what actually did but knew this wasn good for my career in the long term had no industry programming experience only knew gui drag and drop etl tools and some reporting tools had my sights set on seattle and fully expected to restart my career to get my foot in the door the grind started the grind in august learned python syntax through codecademy did easy and medium level questions on leetcode strings and arrays only did easy medium and hard sql questions on leetcode took aws data analytics course on udemy took hadoop ecosystem course on udemy read through the first two chapters of kimball data warehouse toolkit watched youtube videos on system design learned big on basic level learned basic data structures algorithms interviewing submitted as many applications as could about per day starting in october my response rate was actually pretty decent around went into interviews being honest about my experience told interviewers that wanted to pivot into something more technical made it obvious that learning and new challenges are what enjoy it true what everyone says only got asked easy level python questions in interviews even amazon asked easy level questions the only exception was uber for sql leetcode hard is not enough from my experience sql interview questions are on whole other level expect triple or quadruple nested query using multiple ctes and less common functions like mod it sounds hard but if you know sql pretty well it should be easy for you to piece together solution was never asked about aws or hadoop however was asked about data modeling and system design so knowing about cloud systems and big data frameworks at high level ended up being beneficial expect to also be asked about devops troubleshooting and creating fault tolerant pipelines wasn asked about big notation specifically but the interviewer will at least expect you to know about where some efficiency improvements can be made in your code example using two pointer sliding window approach instead of using double nested for loop guess this point can be tied to ds too result didn get any offers from top tier companies but for the offer accepted ended up getting offered senior level position since have almost years industry experience it not faang but something at least satisfied with since fully expected to restart my career was kind of surprised but going to trust in the process here lol for the people who have been messaging me good luck on your journey know it seems like an

step by step guide to creating data catalog,simple data cataloging starts with great organization data catalog is collection of metadata and documentation that helps make sense of the data sprawl that exists in most growing companies getting together and starting to use data catalog is simple process but starting to get adoption and having the dictionary exist as part of your workflow is little bit more difficult even though it may seem like an easy task getting different stakeholders to change their routines and start using new tool can be very challenging an example of the data catalog problems shared by one of the delivery companies we spoke with at this company it was difficult to get aligned on which tables were commonly used joined how they were used together and what columns meant similarly it difficult to monitor the number of data assets that exist across different departments especially when the number of resources grows at faster rate than people why is this the case data is becoming more decentralized through concepts like the data mesh as more teams outside of the data function start to use data in their day to day different tables dashboards and definitions are being created at an almost exponential rate data catalogs are important because they help you organize your data whether you are working with structured or unstructured data they help you identify what kind of data you have how it is related to each other and what the best means to store it is so that you can quickly find it when needed below are the steps that teams need to take when creating data catalog gather sources from across the organization the first step data teams need to take is to collect the different resources that are scattered across different tools in the origination this may require multiple meetings and stakeholders to come together and figure out which resources need to be in the catalog today this collection could be done in spreadsheet with an ongoing list of all resources and how they connect give each resource an owner after data teams have identified all the resources from across the company that they would like to include in their data catalog we recommend assigning ownership to each resource teams that we ve worked within the past have assigned ownership based on the source schema or even domain teams that start assigning ownership should look for people who are familiar with the data knowledge they are responsible for managing and are willing to help others who want to learn how to use it get support and sign off once these meetings conclude and owners are on the same page have the owners sign off on their responsibilities the owners should be in alignment with the documentation and feel like the data team worked collaboratively with them to come to this ownership structure one effective strategy is to involve the leadership team in the exercise early to make sure that their team leads are signing off on the owners of data this way leadership can see how widespread the understanding of data is across the company if the team leadership team sees the value of data catalog this can move at much faster pace integrate the catalog base into your workflow after data teams have received support for their data documentation process they should look for ways to integrate this tool into their workflow this step is critical for maintenance and upkeep without tool that allows teammates to receive notifications on slack it will likely be forgotten by creating process around the data catalog teams can ensure that it is not left behind as the team grows upkeep the data catalog although the documentation should be stable it may need to change over time one instance that might require documentation to change is when new revenue stream is introduced or when the pricing of an existing revenue line changes these changes traditionally come from the business team and might require the data team to implement the changes into the data catalog teams that invest the time to get alignment using data catalog can see major benefits in the long term as they make faster decisions as team creating data catalog is not small undertaking tou can read the full step by step guide here if you found this post useful,0,step by step guide to creating data catalog,simple data cataloging start with great organization data catalog is collection of metadata and documentation that help make sense of the data sprawl that exists in most growing company getting together and starting to use data catalog is simple process but starting to get adoption and having the dictionary exist a part of your workflow is little bit more difficult even though it may seem like an easy task getting different stakeholder to change their routine and start using new tool can be very challenging an example of the data catalog problem shared by one of the delivery company we spoke with at this company it wa difficult to get aligned on which table were commonly used joined how they were used together and what column meant similarly it difficult to monitor the number of data asset that exist across different department especially when the number of resource grows at faster rate than people why is this the case data is becoming more decentralized through concept like the data mesh a more team outside of the data function start to use data in their day to day different table dashboard and definition are being created at an almost exponential rate data catalog are important because they help you organize your data whether you are working with structured or unstructured data they help you identify what kind of data you have how it is related to each other and what the best mean to store it is so that you can quickly find it when needed below are the step that team need to take when creating data catalog gather source from across the organization the first step data team need to take is to collect the different resource that are scattered across different tool in the origination this may require multiple meeting and stakeholder to come together and figure out which resource need to be in the catalog today this collection could be done in spreadsheet with an ongoing list of all resource and how they connect give each resource an owner after data team have identified all the resource from across the company that they would like to include in their data catalog we recommend assigning ownership to each resource team that we ve worked within the past have assigned ownership based on the source schema or even domain team that start assigning ownership should look for people who are familiar with the data knowledge they are responsible for managing and are willing to help others who want to learn how to use it get support and sign off once these meeting conclude and owner are on the same page have the owner sign off on their responsibility the owner should be in alignment with the documentation and feel like

how to replicate production mysql data for devs to use in local docker,we have large gb aws rds mysql production database that runs our web app previously when dev needed to create new features or alter tables they would run mysql dump from our production database and load the data into their own local instance of mysql then begin development but the mysql dump process anonymizes scrubs the data and takes about hours each time instead of doing the dump which takes lot of time we created docker image that fills mysql database with prepared seeding dataset but this seeding dataset will need to be manually up kept to mimic the production database when column is added to production that column will need to be manually added to the seeding dataset so the seeding dataset will need to be maintained by someone to ensure it is robust enough for dev work in the future our data is customer oriented so we thought about taking subset of customers and using that subset to seed the rest of our database but were unsure how we would enforce all the foreign key constraints associated for each customer and the related tables within the subset what methods do you all use to replicate production servers so that devs can have their own independent development database,0,how to replicate production mysql data for devs to use in local docker,we have large gb aws rds mysql production database that run our web app previously when dev needed to create new feature or alter table they would run mysql dump from our production database and load the data into their own local instance of mysql then begin development but the mysql dump process anonymizes scrub the data and take about hour each time instead of doing the dump which take lot of time we created docker image that fill mysql database with prepared seeding dataset but this seeding dataset will need to be manually up kept to mimic the production database when column is added to production that column will need to be manually added to the seeding dataset so the seeding dataset will need to be maintained by someone to ensure it is robust enough for dev work in the future our data is customer oriented so we thought about taking subset of customer and using that subset to seed the rest of our database but were unsure how we would enforce all the foreign key constraint associated for each customer and the related table within the subset what method do you all use to replicate production server so that devs can have their own independent development database

guidance on whether to store data using temporal tables or just using columns for representing time in mssql server,good afternoon was just looking for some advice on how to store my data as know have multiple alternatives and not really sure which one is the best some background first have project where extracting data from yelp rest api which looking to store in regular sql server database and then from there ingest the data into dwh and after integrate an api so people can query the data this api might even implement ml algo have to see now the json data has this structure approximately see the image below and there also other endpoints from which plan on ingesting data but this here is the focus of my question with that in mind know making decisions about design always should have the end goal in mind so the sql server database would serve as way for users to do time series analysis on businesses rating and review count and see how that changes over time so because the json shows the current review count of business decided to treat the data as one would treat stock data and just add new records at set time each day at least initially as would like to change this later on so technically this would involve incremental data loads however with this in mind came across this feature of temporal tables and in the microsoft documentation specifically in the section titled oltp with auto generated data history they have an usage scenario regarding inventory management which is technically the same as my usage scenario for example they are maintaining the inventory count of product and in my case doing the same thing but with business review count so now not sure whether should go ahead with the temporal tables because not sure if there could be unforeseen negative consequences in the future or if just setting up datetime columns apart from temporal table would be better maybe they re accomplishing the same thing and temporal tables are more simple to use maybe coming at this from completely erroneous perspective would like to add as well that plan on using temporal tales regardless on other tables in my db as would like to implement scd in my dwh for the potential changes in the dimensions and also if it helps ve thought about changing the way represent changes in businesses review count by just programming way for difference in the review count between the businesses current state let say today and previous state let say it last place in the table and like so creating sort of transaction based table that just adds reviews into the table so kind of like purchases but not quite immutable data so hope explained myself and would be willing to provide lot more information if you made it this far already grateful haha any suggestions help is

how to build on premise data lake using open source tools,hello folks follow this community for quite while now and found it as an incredible helpful source to get started with data engineering however am recently bit stuck on the topic on how to build data lake on premise using open source tools let me give you some context am currently working part time at young company while also studying in graduate data science program currently am the only one working on this task and my knowledge of data engineering is limited to these topics so far know how to build and use relational databases recently used postgresql for this experimented with etl orchestration frameworks such as airflow and argo workflows events at former company worked at got into touch with graphql where queried the data needed which was stored at aws experimented recently with object storage such as minio recently tried to combine minio with trino to query the data in the object storage with rather limited success the company am working for right now is operating in domain where it is not possible to upload the data to one of the common cloud providers my task is to find data management solution the constraints are that it should take in any kind of data that could be binary data image data csv json ets currently the data is stored in files on server where it is used to build pocs by other team members there is no senior data engineer on the team ideally everything should work in kubernetes know this could be better basis to start with but this is what have right now try to find as much information as possible on the internet or books like these the enterprise big data lake trino the definitive guide designing data intensive applications data pipelines pocket reference building machine learning pipelines but am at stage where many authors may it be online or offline in texts or videos either just explain the very basics what is an object storage or they talk about very sophisticated architectures which can be found at airbnb uber and like often at one of the big cloud providers what need is the step in the middle and on premise how do build data lake that holds data of different levels of transformations and make this available to the team members currently would do the following using tools that work in kubernetes but ignore this for now am building poc which runs locally setup minio and create different zones such as raw refined trusted etc with these different zones could manage the access rights and make data available at different levels of processing available for the respective users setup the injestion etls using either argo or kubeflow the data from these pipelines will land in the raw zone transform data from the raw zone to the subsequent zones using argo or kubeflow etls make the data in the different zones searchable queryable how the last point is my biggest blocking point read that you need to catalogue your data using metadata to make it queryable but what is the best practice for this would add some metadata during the injestion period and store this and the file path to the object in object store in an relational db to make it queryable maybe also an indicator of level of transformation so the user knows whether it is available in subsequent bucket would be immensely happy if some of you could provide me with some insights on how to build such thing or at least how to make my current setup queryable my online research is already pretty exhausted and the only thing find now is new tool that promises to give you

why should you use graph database,what is graph database what all the buzz about graph databases well it not just buzz the graph database market is exploding and so is the usage of graph databases in operational systems the limitations of the relational database management system rdbms model such as strict schemas and strong consistency along with the explosion of data and data types has led software developers and data architects to explore alternative data models for the past couple decades relational databases were not designed to traverse relationships between things they were intended to catalog and retrieve structured data also as data volumes increase relational databases require much more complex engineering and administration and their performance and reliability degrade significantly the not only sql or nosql database movement emerged in the early it gave developers and architects greater freedom to store and query data in new and innovative ways versus dealing with the restrictions and limitations of rdbms and sql the database types within nosql include key value stores wide column stores document databases and graph databases one of the key advantages of using graph database is the ability to model real world situations where there is lots of data and there are many complex connections between the data not only reflected in the graph model but also as new connections are discovered the foundation of modern data graph forms the foundation of modern data and analytics with capabilities to enhance and improve user collaboration machine learning models and explainable ai source graph databases enable the traversal of relationships and connections or nodes and edges within complex data structures often referred to as graph data the technical model of graph database is the focus on relationships and ability to store the graph querying relationships is fast because they are stored within the database itself moreover relationships can be easily visualized using graph databases for an application if the connections between data are as important or more important than the data itself to the dominant queries then you need database that natively supports relationships this particularly applies to navigational and pathfinding queries graph databases have an inherent advantage in cutting through big data clutter and

how to integrate fortran technical analysis stage or any other compiled language into python pipeline for automated stock trading,so have been building few trading bots for while not super complex but get the gist of it all of them have been in python ingest both streaming and historical stock data from like an alpaca or polygon and do some transformations with pandas and some very basic technical analysis with python libraries like ta and bta lib then push trade signals with some combination of aws lambda and or tradingview and so on up until now have managed to do this almost completely in python maybe some js here and there but nothing significant now recently have been thinking about partnering with guy who is absolutely great at data science and analysis he is an older well seasoned guy who only operates in fortran as his background was engineering we are now trying to see how we can work with each other he has worked with both large data sets and streamed sensors data however he has no knowledge of internet protocols or these fancy apis or how to ultimately implement his analysis into actual order execution we are in the process of exploring if and how we can work together so as we are currently thinking through it would be setting up the ingest pipeline and the storage infrastructure he would be doing the technical analysis don know if fortran has some good http libraries for actual trade signaling and order execution so am guessing would be taking care of that part as well also haven worked with compiled languages in my pipelines so my ask is advice on how to set this up how can have the fortran technical analysis part communicate with both the ingest especially streaming data and the signaling and trade execution parts what sort of things and libraries should be looking out for would introducing microservices into my otherwise monolothic architecture help or does pub sub work better doing pub sub with fortran is that thing couldn find any documentation on working fortran with aws lambda or exposing endpoints with fortran so does this mean would have to introduce another intermediary store for generated signals and then work with those with python honestly any criticism or advice would be greatly appreciated know could try to learn fortran but am trying to avoid that if possible it takes really long time to know the ins and outs of language so even just high level description like ingest with this store like that expose with this analyze with that push with this execute with that would help greatly really want to understand how to work with

question on basics of segmentation and compaction concept from designing data intensive applications book,reading through designing data intensive applications and am on chapter where the author describes segmentation and compaction the basics of it at least the argument here is that we can run out of memory if we keep on appending to one segment curious how does segmentation help here if you have one big file of size and divide it into some parts isn the total size the same how would this help us if we run out of memory maybe this is something covered later in the book but it bit confusing to me guess can see how maybe you run out of memory on one disk and you use segmentation to write to another but it not making sense how this saves us from the issue of running out of memory there probably some fuller picture thing missing here thanks in advance,0,question on basic of segmentation and compaction concept from designing data intensive application book,reading through designing data intensive application and am on chapter where the author describes segmentation and compaction the basic of it at least the argument here is that we can run out of memory if we keep on appending to one segment curious how doe segmentation help here if you have one big file of size and divide it into some part isn the total size the same how would this help u if we run out of memory maybe this is something covered later in the book but it bit confusing to me guess can see how maybe you run out of memory on one disk and you use segmentation to write to another but it not making sense how this save u from the issue of running out of memory there probably some fuller picture thing missing here thanks in advance
