### Problem Statement

The “SAT or ACT?” problem has always plagued the minds of would-be college students. Coupled with the problem of poverty in the United States, there are serious issues of high achieving students not being able to proceed to college due to them coming from lower-income families.

Hence, this project seeks to understand trends in the SAT and ACT tests for the years 2017 to 2019 and if household income level has an impact on participation rate and performance of these tests.

### Conclusions and Recommendations

#### Conclusion and key takeaways:

- Median income is moderately positively correlated to ACT scores and negatively correlated to SAT scores.
- Median income is moderately negatively correlated to ACT participation and positively correlated to SAT participation.
- Students are likely to only take one type of test, either the SAT or ACT.
- ACT is preferred over the SAT across the nation and states, but SAT growing in participation.
- ACT / SAT scores are moderately inversely related to participation rate; the higher the participation rate, the lower the mean score of tests.

#### Recommendations to increase participation rate and mean test performances:

- Offering test fee waivers to lower entry barrier of students from low-income families
- Offering bursaries/grants to high achieving students from low-income families, especially states with mandatory ACT
- Advocate for and support schools which strive to achieve equity of outcomes
- Advocate for and support intervention programs that provide academic, social and community support to raise the success of disadvantaged children and youth
- Increase student and family awareness of college accessibility
- Train school staff to encourage and inculcate a 'college going' culture
- Mandating completion of ACT / SAT for high school students
